# Gulp Inject SCSS

Transpile Javascript variables into SCSS variables during the pipe task.

Basically the same principle as [Postilabs](https://github.com/positlabs/inject-scss#readme) Inject SCSS page, only this variation works with pipes. So you can inject SCSS variables directly before your SCSS compilation.

### Installation
```
npm i gulp-inject-scss --save
```
### Setup
```
const injectScss = require('gulp-inject-scss')
```
